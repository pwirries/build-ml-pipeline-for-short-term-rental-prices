# Build an ML Pipeline for Short-Term Rental Prices in NYC
https://github.com/pwirries/build-ml-pipeline-for-short-term-rental-prices

This project was completed as part of the Udacity "Building a Reproducible Machine Learning Workflow"
course that is part of the "Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Nanodegree" program they offer.

The prompt for the project is as follows:
You are working for a property management company renting rooms and properties for short periods of 
time on various rental platforms. You need to estimate the typical price for a given property based 
on the price of similar properties. Your company receives new data in bulk every week. The model needs 
to be retrained with the same cadence, necessitating an end-to-end pipeline that can be reused.

A large portion of the code in this repository comes from the branch it is forked from.

## Experiment Tracking
Experiment tracking for this pipeline is performed using Weights and Biases, the project and associated
runs from developing the pipeline can be found here:
